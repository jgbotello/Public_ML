In this document, I seek to provide mathematical and coding insights about cluster analysis. This approach is based on the review of various papers and websites. Primarily, I share my perspective and acquired knowledge with the goal of providing a useful tool to those interested in the subject.

## What is Clustering Analysis
Cluster analysis is a technique within the field of Pattern Recognition. Basically, Its main objective is to group a set of data into groups or "clusters" based on similarities or common patterns among the elements [1]. In other words, it seeks to identify groups of data that are more similar to each other than to data outside their group. The cluster approach is useful in a variety of application fields, such as market research, astronomy, psychiatry, genomics, social network analytics and many other areas where patterns or hidden structures can be found in unlabeled data [2].

| Year | key, categorical | Horizontal spatial region (X-axis) |
| Total Women Who Had Children | value, quantitative | Vertical position on a common scale (Y-axis) |
